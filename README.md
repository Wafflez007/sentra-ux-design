## 🎨 UX Strategy & Key Features

The design addresses the core challenge of the original site (text-heavy, corporate feel) by shifting to a **student-centric, trust-based layout**.

### 1. Trust First
- **Verified Badges:** Immediate visual cues (stats banner, "Verified Experts" tags) reassure users that the counselors are legitimate.
- **Transparent Pricing:** Counselor cards display hourly rates and star ratings upfront, reducing friction and anxiety.

### 2. Streamlined User Journey
- **4-Step Process:** The complex process of finding a counselor is simplified into a clear, visual roadmap: *Browse → Chat → Hire → Succeed*.
- **Smart "Post a Brief" Feature:** Instead of a generic contact form, the "Post a Brief" section is visualized as a live notification card, showing users exactly what happens when they submit a request (getting multiple offers).

### 3. Modern Aesthetic (Glassmorphism)
- **Tech Stack:** Built with **HTML5** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Visuals:** Uses a clean "Glassmorphism" navbar, `Plus Jakarta Sans` typography, and soft gradients to create a premium, approachable feel similar to modern SaaS platforms (like Stripe or Linear).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** For rapid, responsive styling.
- **FontAwesome:** for icons.
- **Google Fonts:** `Plus Jakarta Sans` for modern typography.
